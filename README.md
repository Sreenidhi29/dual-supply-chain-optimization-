# dual-supply-chain-optimization-
Naan-mudhalvan-sem4-final project

abstract:
This project addresses two major challenges in the logistics and supply chain sector: labour shortages 
and the increasing demand for sustainable operations. To tackle these, our system focuses on route 
optimization and carbon footprint tracking, enabling businesses to streamline deliveries, reduce fuel 
usage, and operate efficiently with limited manpower. Designed for logistics companies, e-commerce 
platforms, and transportation services, the system uses real-world datasets—such as delivery routes, 
vehicle details, and emission metrics—to simulate and improve performance. Developed using PyCharm, 
the solution offers a scalable approach that balances operational productivity with environmental 
responsibility, making it a valuable tool for industries aiming to align with eco-friendly practices.
